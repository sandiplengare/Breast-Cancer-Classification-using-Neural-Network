This project leverages neural network-based machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer into benign and malignant cases. By analyzing medical imaging data, such as mammograms or biopsies, the neural network model assists in early cancer detection, aiding in timely treatment and potentially saving lives. The model learns to identify patterns and features in the data, providing an efficient and accurate diagnostic tool for medical professionals.
